# Ecommerce-website-with-payment-integration

This is an Ecommerce website with login, logout, cart, checkout functionality with Paypal Payment Integration
implemented with Django framework.


- To test the paypal payment functionality during checkout, you need to have a Paypal Sandbox Personal Account. Visit this link to
create one >> https://developer.paypal.com/developer/accounts/
- You would be given a test email and password (Essentially a test paypal account) to process your checkout.

- You can also check out this link for how to create a Sandbox paypal account >> https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api-basics/sandbox/accounts/?_ga=2.10202807.36877198.1632555092-2057487084.1632554814#create-and-manage-sandbox-accounts
